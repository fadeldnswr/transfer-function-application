# transfer-function-application
A transfer function is a mathematical representation of the relationship between the input and output of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system in the frequency domain. It describes how the system processes signals, typically in terms of their frequency content, and is often used in control theory and signal processing to analyze and design systems. This program is made by App Designer MATLAB so it has a GUI on it.

# Inside the Program
This program will get the input of two Transfer Function and calculate it's overall Transfer Function, based on cascaded system theory.
This program will show the Pole, Zero and Gain of the overall Transfer Function.
This program will show the graph of impulse response and step response of the overall Transfer Function.
